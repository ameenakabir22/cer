# Cervical Cancer Classification Model

This project provides a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify cervical cell images as either healthy or unhealthy, supporting early detection and analysis of cervical cancer. Built with deep learning, the model uses an image dataset to train, validate, and test its accuracy, contributing to medical applications in cancer diagnostics.

Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by classifying images of cervical cells using a deep learning model. The model distinguishes between healthy and unhealthy cervical cells, aiding healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases of cervical cancer.

## Dataset
The model was trained using the Spikamed dataset, a comprehensive collection of cervical cell images divided into training, validation, and test sets. Images were preprocessed and categorized as healthy or unhealthy based on cellular characteristics.
 
Classes: Healthy, Unhealthy

Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, e.t.c were applied to ensure optimal input for the model.
